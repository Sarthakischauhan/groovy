# Groovy
A simple expense tracking app using NextJS, TailwindCSS, Supabase.
## Goals for this project.
This is supposed to be a personal utility for expense tracking. What I aim for in this app are the following features.
1. Tracking daily expenses
2. Ability to add income(hourly/weekly). Also to track current net worth.
3. Track estimated and current expenses
4. Get infographics based on your data. 
5. **Apple pay/wallet integration with the supabase database**
